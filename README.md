# Management-and-control-of-a-greenhouse-with-ESP32
The variables we are interested in are humidity, temperature and illumination. To obtain these variables we will use three sensors: BH1750 (luminosity), SEN0193 (humidity) and SCD30 (CO2 and temperature). The data received will be transmitted to the user and processed in order to be able to make decisions according to the climatic conditions.
